## Features

### Conventional Indicators

This collection includes widely-used technical indicators to analyze market.

#### Trend Indicators
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Calculates the arithmetic mean of prices over a specified period. Used to identify trend direction and potential support/resistance levels. Smoother than price action but lags behind current price.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Similar to SMA but assigns more weight to recent prices. Responds more quickly to price changes than SMA. Commonly used in MACD and other complex indicators.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Consists of MACD line (difference between fast and slow EMAs). Includes signal line (EMA of MACD line) and histogram. Used to identify trend changes and momentum.
- **Parabolic SAR (Stop And Reverse)**: Plots points that indicate potential trend reversals. Provides explicit entry and exit signals. Particularly useful in trending markets.

#### Volatility Indicators
- **Bollinger Bands (BB)**: Consists of three bands: middle (SMA) and two outer bands. Outer bands represent standard deviations from the middle band. Helps identify volatility expansions/contractions and potential price extremes.
- **Average True Range (ATR)**: Measures market volatility based on price ranges. Accounts for gaps between trading sessions. Often used for position sizing and stop-loss placement.

#### Momentum Indicators
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Oscillator that measures speed and magnitude of price movements. Ranges from 0 to 100. Traditional overbought/oversold levels at 70/30.
- **Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH)**: Compares closing price to high-low range over time. Consists of %K (fast) and %D (slow) lines. Helps identify potential reversal points.
- **Williams %R**: Similar to Stochastic Oscillator but inverted. Ranges from -100 to 0. Shows overbought/oversold conditions relative to look-back period.
- **Momentum**: Measures rate of change in price movements. Helps identify trend strength and potential reversals. Can be used with various time periods.
- **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**: Measures current price relative to average price. Identifies cyclical turns in price. Used for both trend following and counter-trend strategies.

#### Volume-Based Indicators
- **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**: Cumulative total of volume with direction based on price movement. Used to confirm price trends. Shows potential divergences between price and volume.

In addition to conventional tools, this repository includes advanced metrics that apply scientific principles.

#### Information Theory Based

- **Entropy**: Measures the randomness and unpredictability in price movements. Higher values indicate more disorder/uncertainty in the market.  

        Types implemented:
        - Shannon Entropy: Classical measure of information content
        - Approximate Entropy: More robust to noise than Sample Entropy  
    
        Applications:
        - Market regime detection
        - Volatility forecasting
        - Risk assessment
    <br>
- **Mutual Information**: Quantifies the mutual dependence between different time series. Measures how much information one variable provides about another.

        Applications:
        - Cross-market analysis
        - Lead-lag relationships
        - Market coupling strength estimation

        Features:
        - Time-delayed mutual information for temporal dependencies
        - Cross-mutual information for multi-market analysis
