# Advanced Technical Indicators with Scientific Extensions

This repository features a collection of advanced technical indicators that combine conventional market analysis tools (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI, etc.) with innovative, scientifically developed metrics. These metrics include entropy, mutual information, Lyapunov exponent, Lempel-Ziv complexity, etc., among others, offering unique insights into market dynamics. The indicators are plotted on interactive Bokeh candle charts, providing a highly customizable and visual trading experience.

## Features

- **Conventional Indicators:** Includes commonly used indicators such as moving averages (SMA, EMA), RSI, Stoch RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more.
- **Scientific Indicators:** Unique metrics developed using scientific methods such as:
    - Entropy: Measures the degree of uncertainty in price movement.
    - Mutual Information: Quantifies the dependency between asset prices.
    - Lyapunov Exponent: Assesses the sensitivity of price systems to initial conditions.
    - Lempel-Ziv Complexity: Quantifies complexity and patterns within price data.
    - Interactive Visualizations: All indicators are integrated into interactive Bokeh candle charts for a seamless user experience, allowing you to zoom, pan, and explore market data dynamically.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the available indicators. Customize the inputs (timeframes, parameters) for the specific indicators you wish to analyze. Interact with the Bokeh charts for visualizing market patterns and dynamics.
