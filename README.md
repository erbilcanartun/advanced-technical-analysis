## Features

### Conventional Indicators

This collection includes widely-used technical indicators to analyze market.

#### Trend Indicators
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Calculates the arithmetic mean of prices over a specified period. Used to identify trend direction and potential support/resistance levels. Smoother than price action but lags behind current price.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Similar to SMA but assigns more weight to recent prices. Responds more quickly to price changes than SMA. Commonly used in MACD and other complex indicators.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Consists of MACD line (difference between fast and slow EMAs). Includes signal line (EMA of MACD line) and histogram. Used to identify trend changes and momentum.
- **Parabolic SAR (Stop And Reverse)**: Plots points that indicate potential trend reversals. Provides explicit entry and exit signals. Particularly useful in trending markets.

#### Volatility Indicators
- **Bollinger Bands (BB)**: Consists of three bands: middle (SMA) and two outer bands. Outer bands represent standard deviations from the middle band. Helps identify volatility expansions/contractions and potential price extremes.
- **Average True Range (ATR)**: Measures market volatility based on price ranges. Accounts for gaps between trading sessions. Often used for position sizing and stop-loss placement.

#### Momentum Indicators
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Oscillator that measures speed and magnitude of price movements. Ranges from 0 to 100. Traditional overbought/oversold levels at 70/30.
- **Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH)**: Compares closing price to high-low range over time. Consists of %K (fast) and %D (slow) lines. Helps identify potential reversal points.
- **Williams %R**: Similar to Stochastic Oscillator but inverted. Ranges from -100 to 0. Shows overbought/oversold conditions relative to look-back period.
- **Momentum**: Measures rate of change in price movements. Helps identify trend strength and potential reversals. Can be used with various time periods.
- **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**: Measures current price relative to average price. Identifies cyclical turns in price. Used for both trend following and counter-trend strategies.

#### Volume-Based Indicators
- On-Balance Volume (OBV): Cumulative total of volume with direction based on price movement. Used to confirm price trends. Shows potential divergences between price and volume.

### Scientific Indicators

In addition to conventional tools, this repository includes advanced metrics that apply scientific principles.

- Entropy: Quantifies uncertainty or disorder in price movements, offering insight into market unpredictability.
- Mutual Information: Measures the dependency between time-series data points to reveal hidden relationships within the price series.
- Multifractal Analysis: Identifies scaling behaviors in time-series data, uncovering patterns that emerge across different time horizons.
- Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA): Detects the recurrence of states in a system, helping to uncover hidden patterns or chaotic behavior in the market.
- Complexity Measures: Includes methods such as Lempel-Ziv complexity to gauge the randomness and structural complexity within time-series data.
- Lyapunov Exponent: A chaos indicator that quantifies the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, helping to detect chaotic or stable behavior.
